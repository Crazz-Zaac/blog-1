# Yunpeng's Blog

This repository is meant for [Yunpeng](https://yunpengn.github.io/)'s personal blog website. It is proudly powered by [Hexo.js](https://hexo.io/).

## Why I choose Hexo.js

- The front-end styling should be reasonably consistent and polished. For a developer like me who is better at backend programming, it is difficult to start front-end design from scratch. Thus, I have to choose a framework, or a website generator.
- I want a blog website that only consists of static webpages. This provides me with more options to host it. For instance, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) certainly only supports static webpages. Thus, I cannot use any content management system (CMS) with dynamic pages, like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).
- I want to use a Windows-based development machine. This means some programming languages like Ruby may be troublesome. Thus, I will not choose engines like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
