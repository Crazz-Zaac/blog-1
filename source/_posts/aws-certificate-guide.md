Hi guys, it has been a long time since my last post. In the past few months, I have been preparing for the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) examination, which is part of the series of [AWS Certificate Examination](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/).

This examination (and its siblings) focus on some cloud computing concepts, as well as a lot of details specific to the services provided by AWS. To prepare for this examination, there are a few important learning resources:

- [Official Examination Guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS_Certified_Solutions_Architect_Associate_Feb_2018_%20Exam_Guide_v1.5.2.pdf) and [sample questions](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_Certified_Solutions_Architect_Associate_Sample_Questions.pdf);
- AWS whitepapers, which have been collected and available at https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/;
- [AWS Training Learn Library](https://www.aws.training/LearningLibrary), which offers a free subscription currently;
- Some online courses, of which [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/) being one of the most popular providers.

However, the content of the examination is updated almost every year and the questions contain a wide range of aspects as well. I found the above mentioned resources either out-of-dated, too lengthy or have a different focus from the actual examination. Thus, I decided to write a preparation guide myself.

**Now, introduce the [AWS Certificate Examination Preparation Guide](https://yunpengn.github.io/CertAWS/), authored by [Yunpeng Niu](https://yunpengn.github.io/):**

The guide is proudly created by [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), and **_now have been made available at https://yunpengn.github.io/CertAWS/_**.

This guide is based on the personal experience of Yunpeng, and aims at providing just the coverage of information you need to pass the examination.

## Is this Guide Really Useful?

Well, I have thrilled to make it as useful as possible. Personally, I have passed the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) examination on [2 July 2019](https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=1&t=c&d=2019-07-02&ci=AWS00898411):

And I have included all of my knowledge regarding AWS into this guide. Thus, you should be able to pass the examination easily after careful study of the guide.

## Good Luck!
