Hi, this is [Yunpeng](https://yunpengn.github.io). This website is my personal blog. Sometimes, I will post things interesting and worth to mention in my daily life.

I love coding and software engineering. Thus, this blog will contain some technical discussion as well. If you do not agree with me or find a better solution or a clearer understanding to the problem, you may kindly leave a comment. I always strive to make sure my code is clear, precise and concise, in that order of importantce. Please follow such coding style when you want to include code snippets.
